## PROJECT SUMMARY
Being an e-commerce project, this study aims to track the sales and revenue patterns of biking equipment and accessories, alongside, customer trends in 6 countries: The United States, Canada, Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Following the March 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people worldwide looked for alternate methods to move around and stay active when gyms shut down and public transportation became unsafe. In the U.S., consumer spending on bicycles and accessories peaked in 2021, according to adjusted figures from the *U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis*. 

Datasets were obtained from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/algorismus/adventure-works-in-excel-tables/data)**. Sales and return data are available for the period between 01/01/2020 and 30/06/2022.

## Key Features

- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales, revenue, profit, and returns.
- Compare performance across different countries.
- Analyse product-level trends.
- Identify high-value customers.

## Key Steps
`Data Preparation` - Files were downloaded in CSV format. I then duplicated all these files and began preparing my data in Microsoft Excel. To develop key insights from my analysis, I came up with some key business questions. 
- Which biking accessories generate the most revenue?
- What is the revenue trend over different time periods (monthly, quarterly, annually)?
- Who are the top customers based on total revenue generated?
- Which customer segments contribute the most to profits?
- What is the demographic profile of the customer base (age, gender, location)?
- Are there any patterns in order times (day of the week, time of day)?
- What is the profit trend over different time periods?
- How do returns and refunds affect profits?
