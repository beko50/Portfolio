# Data Analyst Portfolio
A portfolio to hoard and showcase my 'all things data' projects. 

## Introduction
Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Bernard Kofi Essiamah and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data visualization and presentation skills. A majority of my projects are done using Microsoft Excel, PostgreSQL, Tableau and Python.
