# Data Analyst Portfolio
My data portfolio to showcase my projects relating to anything and everything data.

## Introduction
Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Bernard Kofi Essiamah and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data visualization and presentation skills. A majority of my projects are done using Microsoft Excel, PostgreSQL, Tableau and Python and Power BI.

## Projects
### Project_1 - FIFA World Cup Insights
This is my very first project in Data Analysis and being a huge football fan, I decided to start with the simplest datasets I found on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset)** website, which contains all previous editions from 1930 to 2022. I went ahead with analyzing football in 21st Century (2002-2022) because the game has vastly changed and these were the ones I experienced mostly. The FIFA World Cup tournament takes place every 4 years with 32 qualified countries all over the world partaking in it. I also added a new column 'Win Rate' to analyze the performance of these countries in a selected period of time. I started working with the datasets in Microsoft Excel before importing it into PostgreSQL and making visualizations with Tableau.
