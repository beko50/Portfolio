# Data Analyst Portfolio
My data portfolio to showcase my projects relating to anything and everything data.

## Introduction
Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Bernard Kofi Essiamah and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data visualization and presentation skills. A majority of my projects are done using Microsoft Excel, PostgreSQL, Tableau,Python and Power BI.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summmary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Let's get started!

## About Me & My Data Journey
I am currently working under contract as an HR Data Analyst at Gundersen Health Systems, Wisconsin, USA where my primary job is to collaborate with stakeholders and create visualizations and reports in Microsoft Power BI per their requirements, assist the Data Engineering team in optimizing ETL processes, etc. I had the opportunity to practice and learn some data engineering techniques and skills in my current role, which I am still improving upon.

My data journey began right after I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana. I took up a business intelligence bootcamp after which I had the chance to intern at Integral Ad Science, a media-adversiting company in USA. It was during this role,after teaming up with the Data Team on several occasions for tasks and reports, which opened up my interest in the data exploration field. I then continued with the Google Data Analytics Professional certification and still learning more here.

## Projects
### Project_1 - FIFA World Cup Insights
This is my very first project in my Data Analysis journey and being a huge football fan, I decided to start with the simplest datasets I found on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset)** website, which contains all previous editions from 1930 to 2022. I went ahead with analyzing football in 21st Century (2002-2022) because the game has vastly changed and these were the ones I experienced mostly. The FIFA World Cup tournament takes place every 4 years with 32 qualified countries all over the world partaking in it. I also added a new column 'Win Rate' to analyze the performance of these countries in a selected period of time. I started working with the datasets in Microsoft Excel before importing it into PostgreSQL and making visualizations with Tableau. 

### Project_2 - E-Commerce Analytics
For this project, I've decided to explore and analyze data in an e-commerce field.
