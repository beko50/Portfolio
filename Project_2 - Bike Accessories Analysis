## SUMMARY OF PROJECT
Being an e-commerce project, this study aims to track the sales patterns of biking equipment and accessories in 6 countries: The United States, Canada, Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Following the March 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people worldwide looked for alternate methods to move around and stay active when gyms shut down and public transportation became unsafe. In the U.S., consumer spending on bicycles and accessories peaked in 2021, according to adjusted figures from the *U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis*. Sales and return data is is available for the period between 01/01/2020 and 30/06/2022.
