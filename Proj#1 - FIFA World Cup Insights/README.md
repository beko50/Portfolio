## Summary of Project
This is my very first project in Data Analysis and being a huge football fan, I decided to start with the simplest datasets I found on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset)** website, which contains all previous editions from 1930 to 2022. I went ahead with the last 5 editions mainy due to the fact those were the ones I experienced. I started working with the datasets in Microsoft Excel before importing it into PostgreSQL and visualizing it with Tableau.
