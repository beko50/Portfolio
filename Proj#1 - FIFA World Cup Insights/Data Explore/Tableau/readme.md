My final analysis were done in Tableau were I was able to visualize the data by desiging dashboards and writing formulas in calculated fields to find the win percentages of countries. I also wrote a story for all the dashboards designed. Below are some insights I came by:

`Dashboard_1.png` - In this dashboard, we have each participating country apperances and their points per games played. There have been 6 tournaments in the 21st Century and the image shows USA have made it to the world stage 5 times with an overall win percentage of 25% which shows underperformance. With the Points per Games Played, the top 10 are: GERMANY, BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, FRANCE,SPAIN, NETHERLANDS,ENGLAND,PORTUGAL, CROATIA and BELGIUM.

`Dashboard_2.png` - This dashboard shows the performances of all countries in recent years. There is the chart for each country's Wins, Draws, Losses and at length, Win Percentages. The formula for Win Percentages is shown in `Tableau formula.png`. Per my analysis, Netherlands have the best WIN % although failing to lift the trophy in recent times. Turkey also have a good WIN % but have not made it to the big stages since 2002. Colombia and Belgium both exceeded expectations in 2014 and 2018 respectively, hence their good WIN %. 

`Storytelling.png` - This aspect tells the details on the dashboards I created earlier. Four detailed stories for the FIFA World Cup in the 21st Century.
