## MS Excel Analysis

## Summary 
Data was organized with datasets from 2002 to 2022. My initial analysis were as follows:

`1` - In 2006, I realized Serbia and Montenegro participated as one country after which they separated into 2 independent countries ever since.

`2` - Most cells had United States while some had USA which called for data duplication. I replaced the former with the latter in my analysis.

`3` - Top 5 performing countries had the most points, best offensive records and games played in the 21st century. They are Brazil, France, Argentina, Spain and Netherlands. All countries having won the trophy except Netherlands who came close to winning it in 2010.
